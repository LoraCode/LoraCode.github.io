    <h2>HI I'M LORA</h2>
    <p>
      Passionate natural born gamer and anime/manga lover at heart. Moved to NYC at the age of 5 to start my
      unpredictable journey without knowing any english. I tackled various learning styles and aquired a portion of
      knowlegde back each and every time. After graduating high school, I came to a realization that my style of
      learning was a mesh between self-teaching and the traditional education methods. Several different skills were
      gained, such as; being able to create technical drawings using AutoCAD, utilizing photoshop for creation, design,
      and editing purposes. Currently I'm a goal-oriented Full-Stack Web Developer, with an understand of programming
      languages such as JavaScript, Ruby, SQL, HTML, and CSS. You can see some of my most recent projects down below...

    <h2>BARNSTORM:REFUEL</h2>
    <p>
      Enter barnSTORM:REfuel. The game places you on the driver's seat of a spacecraft. Your skills are put to the test
      when you're forced
      to collect fuel for your ship while trying to dodge incoming missiles. One hit from those, and
      you're a goner.

    <h2>EXPENSE-TRACKER EXPRESS</h2>
    <p>
      Expense-Tracker stores users, and allows each particular user to log their own expenses.
      The app is meant to provide full control over one user's log history, and it utilizes
      Auth to separate and distinct each transaction logged from their presented user.

    <h2>MOVIE GENERATOR</h2>
    <p>
      This is a Full-stack CRUD web app that allows users to look up movie recommendations, and add
      them to a watch list that can be accessed when they login to their own profiles.
      Users can also add a short review to their favorite movies that will help other users
      discover new favorites.

    <h2>Universal-Block-Explorer</h2>
    <p>
      My most recent project: a full-stack CRUD web app that serves as a Universal API for crypto assets.
      Each asset is ranked based on its transaction volume so users will be able
      to monitor a specific assets activity.
      API endpoints don’t exist for easy access to all of the data stored on-chain, more importantly,
      API endpoints also don’t exist for viewing the blockchain data in aggregate... UNTIL NOW!
